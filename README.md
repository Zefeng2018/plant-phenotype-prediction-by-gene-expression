# Plant phenotype prediction by gene expression

## Inroduction
Research on the dynamic expression of genes in plants is important for understanding different biological processes. In this study, we applied ML approach to a large-scale well-processed gene expression dataset of the two crops, maize and rice, to model the relationship between the gene expression patterns and phenotype (e.g. tissue types, development stages, stress types, etc.). The figure below described the workflow.
